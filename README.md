To turn on and off the pump, most people use a manual switch. As a result, people forget to switch off the pump from time to time, resulting in water overflow. They may forget to switch on the motor at times, resulting in a water problem later on. It also wastes a lot of electricity. To solve this problem, we need a smart device to control the pump.
